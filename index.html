          <ol>
            <li>Diagnostic test: the diagnostic test has 2 questions from each math section (Place value, Addition and subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Fraction, Ratios & Proportions, and percentages.) 
              The survey helped figure out which topic the student should be learning.
              </li>
            <li>Pre-test: Administer a pre-test survey to the primary school students to test the studentsâ€™ knowledge on certain subjects before taking Oppia lessons on the same subject.
            </li>
            <li>Taking lessons and observation: I observed the students using the Oppia app in the classroom,I ensured that users were able to use the app correctly, I assisted them when they needed some help with the use of the app,
              I also gathered information about how they interact with the app and identified the challenges or difficulties they encounter.</li>
            <li>Post-test: I Administered a post-test survey to the students to gather feedback on their experience using the educational web app and to identify any improvements or modifications that could be made to the app.</li>

                <p>On the 17th of March 2023, I paid a visit to Olumo Primary School where I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Solomon, the assistant Headmaster. 
                  During our meeting, I introduced the Oppia lessons app to him, elaborated on the goals and mission of the Oppia foundation, and presented our proposal seeking his consent to run a pilot with some students. 
                 <p>However, Mr. Solomon informed me that I needed the approval of the Education secretary of the local government to carry out the pilot in the school. 
                  Subsequently, I proceeded to meet with the Education secretary where I submitted my proposal and it was approved.</p>

                <h3>LEARNING IS FUN AND INTERACTIVE WITH OPPIA</h3>
                <p>At 11:30am, the pilot commenced with students from primary 4, 5, and 6. The session was divided into three parts, one for each grade level. During the pilot, two mobile phones with the android app and one laptop with the web application were available for use. 
                  The devices were shared among the students, with two students sharing one device. Although they learned together with the devices, each student answered the questions independently.
                </p>
                <img src="images/identify/pic-3.JPG" alt="">
                <p>I introduced the app to the students and explained how the session would run, and they were excited to begin. </p>

                  <p>The first task assigned to them was the diagnostic test, which the first set finished in 12 minutes, while the second and third sets finished in 10 minutes. I assessed the diagnostic test and assigned math topics to each student pair based on the results. Hereâ€™s the link to the result.
                    </p><p>The pre-test was shared with the students based on the subject they performed the least in, and they completed it in 15 minutes. After the test, they began taking Oppia lessons based on the subject assigned to them during the pre-test. The students finished the lessons in 30 minutes. Hereâ€™s the link to the result.
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, the post-test was administered, and each student finished it with an average time of 15 minutes. Here's the link to the result.
                  </p>
                  <h3>The intervention and impact of Oppia can continue on an ongoing basis</h3>
                <p>The Oppia lesson app received a warm reception from various stakeholders, including the Education Secretary, the School's Headmaster, the teachers, and the students.</p>
                <p>Education Secretary expressed appreciation for the fact that the app is free and easily accessible, describing it as a welcomed development. </p>
                  <p>The Assistant Headmaster also praised the initiative, stating that it would be highly appreciated by teachers, students, and parents.
